SnifTern.ai is an AI-powered platform that detects fake internship postings and verifies company legitimacy using advanced machine learning. It offers real-time fraud analysis, multi-platform integration (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor), PDF reports, and multi-language support to protect students from internship scams.

The project organizes around a single goal: provide a dependable, scalable tool for students, educators, and employers to assess internship postings and company credibility. It blends data from job boards, social profiles, and corporate signals to deliver actionable risk scores, checks, and documentation.

Topics covered by this repository include ai-platform, career-protection, flask, internship-fraud-detection, job-scam-prevention, machine-learning, nlp, python, student-safety, and web-scraping.

What SnifTern.ai does
- Real-time fraud analysis: The system analyzes internship postings as soon as they appear and assesses risk based on language patterns, verified company signals, and historical fraud indicators.
- Multi-platform integration: It pulls signals from LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor to cross-validate job postings and company profiles.
- Verification of company legitimacy: The platform checks corporate data points, digital footprints, and public records to estimate credibility.
- PDF reports: Create comprehensive, portable reports for students, campuses, or mentors that summarize risk scores, evidence, and recommendations.
- Multi-language support: The system understands and processes content in multiple languages to support students globally.
- User-friendly outputs: Clear scores, explanations, and recommended actions help users decide how to proceed.

How it works
- Ingestion: The system collects job postings and company data from partner platforms and local inputs.
- Pre-processing: Text normalization, language detection, and feature extraction prepare data for analysis.
- Analysis: A mix of rule-based checks and ML models evaluate each posting and company profile. The models cover NLP signals, behavior patterns, and cross-platform inconsistencies.
- Scoring: Each item receives a risk score with confidence estimates. The score is complemented by explanation tags and evidence links.
- Reporting: PDF reports summarize findings, with sections for method notes, data sources, and suggested actions.
- Output: Results are surfaced in a Flask-based web UI, an API, and export formats for downstream workflows.

Features in depth
- Real-time fraud scoring: The engine continuously analyzes new postings and updates risk assessments as new signals arrive.
- Cross-platform verification: Signals from multiple major job boards and professional networks are reconciled to strengthen detection.
- Explainable results: Each risk score includes a rationale, confidence level, and linkable evidence blocks for auditing.
- PDF reporting: One-click generation of professional reports that can be shared with students, advisors, or campuses.
- Localization: Language detection and translation hooks support users across regions.
- Modular architecture: Microservices-like components allow easy replacement or enhancement of ML models and data sources.
- Extensible rules: A rules engine lets analysts add or tune checks without redeploying core logic.
- Lightweight deployment: The core stack is designed to run on modest hardware with sensible defaults.
- Security-first design: Data handling follows best practices to protect user privacy and system integrity.
- Clear API: RESTful endpoints enable integration with school portals, LMS systems, or campus apps.

Architecture and tech stack
- Backend: Python with Flask for the web API and the user interface backend.
- Machine learning: A mix of NLP-based classifiers, anomaly detectors, and supervised models trained on synthetic and public datasets.
- Data sources: Web scraping modules and connectors to major job platforms; data normalization pipelines standardize inputs.
- Reports: PDF generation using robust templating to produce consistent, professional documents.
- Frontend: A clean admin UI built with responsive web design patterns; supports multi-language content rendering.
- Storage: Local storage for development; scalable options for production include relational databases and object storage.
- Containers: Optional Docker configurations for reproducible environments.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions pipelines for building, testing, and releasing.

Data and privacy
- Data scope: Ingests publicly available postings and signals; respects platform terms and user consent when applicable.
- Privacy controls: Data handling includes access controls, audit logs, and data minimization practices.
- Transparency: Risk scores come with explanations and evidence traces to support auditability.
- Ethics: The project follows ethical guidelines for data use and user safety.

Getting started
- Prerequisites:
  - Python 3.11 or newer
  - Pipenv or virtualenv for isolated environments
  - A supported database backend for persistence (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL or MySQL for production)
  - Optional: Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment
- Quick start overview:
  - Create a virtual environment
  - Install dependencies
  - Run the development server
  - Access the web UI and API docs

Installation and setup
- Clone the repository
- Create a virtual environment:
  - python -m venv venv
  - source venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
- Install dependencies:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
- Prepare environment:
  - Create a .env file with required keys (API keys, database URL, secret keys, etc.)
  - Configure logging level and locale
- Run locally:
  - flask run
  - Open the local URL shown in the console

Running locally
- Development server: The app runs on your local machine with hot reload for rapid iteration.
- API console: The API exposes endpoints to submit postings, fetch results, and request PDF reports.
- Logging: All actions emit structured logs to help trace results and debugging steps.
- Debugging tips: Check logs for missing environment variables, data parsing errors, or failed external calls.

Deployment guide
- Docker-based deployment:
  - Use a docker-compose.yml that defines services for the API, worker processes, and a database.
  - Ensure environment variables are provided through a secure mechanism.
  - Persist data using mounted volumes for database backups.
- Kubernetes path:
  - Deploy a simple set of Pods and a responsive service with health checks.
  - Use ConfigMaps for configuration and Secrets for sensitive values.
- Production readiness:
  - Enable TLS termination, rate limiting, and proper access controls.
  - Monitor with lightweight metrics and basic alerts.

API and integrations
